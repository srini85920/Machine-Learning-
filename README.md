Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning model used mainly for categorical data, and it is a classification algorithm. It is one of the widely used algorithms for classification using machine learning. Seeing the name logistic regression, you may think it will be a regression algorithm. But the fact is that it is a classification algorithm, and it is a generalization of the linear regression model.

Logistic Regression is used to find the relationship between dependent and independent variables. This is done by using a logistic regression equation. This is a very easy to implement, understand, and also easy method to train the model.

To understand it more, think of an example of your email. You will be getting many emails, and in them, some are spam. Using this logistic Regression, we can find whether the mail is spam or ham. It will classify the emails and label them as spam or ham, like 0 or 1.
